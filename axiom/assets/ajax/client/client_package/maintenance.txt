<h2>Quality Maintenance</h2><br />
			
<p class="text-info"> Property managers supervise maintenance.</p>
			
			<p class="text-justify text-muted"><b>We employ only the most skilled and reliable maintenance personnel.</b> Property managers normally supervise necessary home maintenance.  The actual maintenance expenses for the home are the responsibility of the homeowner.  Every effort is made to control maintenance costs while maintaining the integrity and value of the property.  Problem reports are verified to eliminate unnecessary service calls.  Maintenance that is the resident's responsibility or fault is billed to the resident.  All maintenance personnel are properly licensed bonded and insured.  Our staff oversees maintenance and contractors are not paid until all work is satisfactorily completed.<br /><br />
			
To control quality and to manage the high risk of litigation from a maintenance contractor or resident, we use our maintenance team for most routine maintenance needs.  They are employees who are experienced in the skills necessary for residential maintenance.  To control costs we guarantee that the maintenance expense charged by our maintenance team on our managed homes will never be higher than the cost for the same work by another reputable contractor.  In most cases our maintenance team are able to do the work at a considerable savings. </p>
