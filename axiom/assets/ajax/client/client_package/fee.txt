<h2>Management Fees and Other Charges</h2></br>
			
			
			<p class="text-justify" class="text-muted">Property management is a very competitive business.  Some property managers only offer a standard management service while others offer a range of services.  There are different ways property managers can charge for services.  It is important to ask what services are optional or available.  Be sure to understand all possible charges other than a percentage of the rent.
Fees and charges should be addressed completely in the property management agreement.  Examples of common charges for a standard management service are:  flat percentage of rent or a percentage of rent plus fees for individual services.  Example of possible other fees are placement fees for locating a resident and/or charges for advertising, referral fees, lease renewals, fee for closing an account, and miscellaneous administrative expenses. </p>
