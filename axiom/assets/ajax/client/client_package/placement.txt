<h2>Diligent Placement</h2></br>
			
			<p class="text-justify" class="text-muted">Property managers accept calls and inquiries regarding your home. They arrange appointments and coordinate showings of your property.</br></br>
			
			We have an impressive track record in placing quality residents. We attribute this success to our extensive marketing efforts, screening process and commitment to exceptional service.  We believe the most important part of professional property management is finding a quality resident for your home.</br></br>
			
			Our marketing program is the best in Indianapolis. Most important is our reputation. We are known for quality homes and professional management practices. Promotion efforts include media advertising, signs, flyers, outside leasing contractors and our web site. Available homes are showcased weekly to several outside leasing teams, placement and realtor offices. We receive many inquiries by e-mail and our website. </p>
