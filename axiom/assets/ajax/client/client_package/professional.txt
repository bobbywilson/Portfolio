<h2>Professional Management</h2></br>
			
			<p class="text-justify" class="text-muted">Property managers collect rents, deal with resident issues, periodically inspect the property and personally supervise the home. The manager provides an "arms length" relationship between owner and resident.</br></br>
			
By maintaining excellent relations with our residents and diligently caring for your property, we avoid most potential problems. Residents are informed of their responsibilities regarding your property and their contracts. We will quickly and professionally settle any problems that may arise, with our clients' interest in mind.</br></br>

If there is a problem, whether it is collecting rents or settling resident disputes, we will handle the situation appropriately. We are knowledgeable in the State Uniform Owner-Resident Relations Act and all the legal and contractual relationships involved in renting property. If necessary, we are prepared to make a court appearance.</br></br>

We utilize quality control procedures and proven business practices in the management of your home. In addition to the routine management of your home we are on call 24 hours a day 365 days a year. </p>
